        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I started my journey in web design and development to help businesses establish a strong online presence. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in creating websites that are fast, secure, and built to convert. I focus on modern design, intuitive navigation, and seamless user experiences that leave a lasting impression.</p>

        <p>Whether it's designing a sleek portfolio, building an e-commerce platform, or optimizing a website for performance, I approach every project with the same dedication and attention to detail. I love solving problems with creative solutions and ensuring every site meets both client goals and user needs.</p>

        <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring the latest web technologies, learning about UX trends, and finding inspiration in design and art. My goal is to create digital experiences that make a difference.</p>
